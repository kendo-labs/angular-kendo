# AngularJS Integration For Kendo UI

## About angular-kendo

angular-kendo is a directive for AngularJS that runs an element through Kendo UI declarative initialization, allowing you to take full advantage of Kendo UI within the context of an AngularJS Application.

## Compatibility and Requirements

angular-kendo was designed to work with Kendo UI Web / DataViz and AngularJS version 1.0.4.  Version 1.0.3 of AngularJS is not supported [thanks to this bug](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/1627) that is fixed in 1.0.4.

angular-kendo currently depends on the following libraries:

- [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) v1.8.2
- [Kendo UI](http://www.kendoui.com) vCurrent
- [AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org) v1.0.4

angular-kendo has not been tested against any other versions of these libraries. You may find that versions other than these are compatible with angular-kendo, but we make no claims to support those version, nor can we troubleshoot issues that arise when using those versions.

## Source Code and Downloads

This repository contains both the full and minified version of angular-kendo.

## Documentation

## How to Contribute

If you would like to contribute to angular-kendo's source code, please read the [guidelines for pull requests and contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md). Following these guidelines will help make your contributions easier to bring in to the next release.

## Getting Help

StackOverflow is a good place to start, but be sure to read the [documentation for Kendo UI](http://docs.kendoui.com), and of course the [AngularJS documentation](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/)

As a part of Kendo UI Labs, angular-kendo is intended to be a community-run project, and not an official part of any Kendo UI SKU (Web, DataViz, Mobile or Complete). As such, this project is not a supported part of Kendo UI, and is not covered under the support agreements for Kendo UI license holders. Please do not create support requests for this project, as these will be immediately closed and you'll be directed to post your question on a community forum.
