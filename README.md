# AngularJS Integration For Kendo UI

## About angular-kendo

angular-kendo is a directive for AngularJS that allows you to passthrough data attributes to Kendo UI declarative initialization, allowing you to take full advantage of AngularJS directives and resources.

## Compatibility and Requirements

Packaged App Bootstrap was designed to work with Kendo UI Complete and [Chrome Packaged Apps](http://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps.html)

Chrome Packaged App currently depends on the following libraries:

- [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) v1.8.2
- [Kendo UI](http://www.kendoui.com) vCurrent

Packaged App Bootstrap has not been tested against any other versions of these libraries. You may find that versions other than these are compatible with [Project Name], but we make no claims to support those version, nor can we troubleshoot issues that arise when using those versions.

## Source Code and Downloads

The bootstrap is a boilerplate project for a packaged application. Simply downloading or cloning this project is sufficient.

## Documentation

## Getting Help

As a part of Kendo UI Labs, Packaged App Bootstrap is intended to be a community-run project, and not an official part of any Kendo UI SKU (Web, DataViz, Mobile or Complete). As such, this project is not a supported part of Kendo UI, and is not covered under the support agreements for Kendo UI license holders. Please do not create support requests for this project, as these will be immediately closed and you'll be directed to post your question on a community forum.
